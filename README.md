## Developing

I've included my signature gulpfile too so be sure and take a look at that as well.

```bash
$ cd <project directory>
$ npm install
$ gulp
```

I also use [pow](http://pow.cx/) and the [powder gem](https://github.com/Rodreegez/powder) to run my local dev environments but however you plan on wrangling that the gulpfile turns on a livereload server so as long as you have the files serving somehow any changes you make will show up instantly.
